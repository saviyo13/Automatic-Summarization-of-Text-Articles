# Automatic-Summarization-of-Text-Articles

Text Summarization has always been an area of active interest in the
academia. In recent times, even though several techniques have being
developed for automatic text summarization, efficiency is still a concern.
Given the increase in size and number of documents available online,
an efficient automatic news summarizer is the need of the hour.

With the availability of World Wide Web in every corner of the
world these days, the amount of information on the internet is growing
at an exponential rate. However, given the hectic schedule of people
and the immense amount of infor- mation available, there is increase in
need for information abstraction or summarization. Text summarization
presents the user a shorter version of text with only vital information and
thus helps him to understand the text in shorter amount of time.The goal
of automatic text summarization is to condense the documents or
reports into a shorter version and preserve important contents.

In this paper, we propose a technique of text summarization
which focuses on the problem of identifying the most important portions
of the text and producing coherent summaries. In our methodology, we
donot require full semantic interpretation of the text, instead we create a
summary using a model of topic progression in the text derived from
lexical chains. We present an optimized and efficient algorithm to
generate text summary using lexical frequency and using the Natural
Language Toolkit.
